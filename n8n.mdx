## Getting Started

We have created an n8n node to help you integrate Pingmee with your automations. This node provides a seamless way to connect Pingmee's messaging and automation features directly within your n8n workflows.

<Warning>
  This node can only be installed when n8n is self-hosted. Community nodes are not available on n8n Cloud.
</Warning>

## Install the Node

To install the Pingmee node in your self-hosted n8n instance:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Community nodes**
2. Click **Install**
3. Enter the package name: `n8n-nodes-pingmee`
4. Click **Install**

Alternatively, you can find the package on npm:

[n8n-nodes-pingmee on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-pingmee)
[n8n-nodes-pingmee on ncnodes](https://ncnodes.com/package/n8n-nodes-pingmee)

Once installed, you can add the Pingmee node to your n8n workflows and start automating your messaging workflows.

- **Subscribe to message/conversation webhooks** - Receive important events
- **Send Messages** - Automatically send messages to customers
- **Work with Templates** - Use message templates in your automations

## Authentication

To authenticate the Pingmee node, you need to create a new credential in n8n:

1. Go to your Pingmee account settings
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Developer**
3. Copy your API token
4. In n8n, create a new credential for the Pingmee node
5. Paste the token into the credential configuration

<Note>
  Each API usage will be logged using that token, which is unique per agent. Make sure you have an active Pingmee account before setting up credentials.
</Note>
